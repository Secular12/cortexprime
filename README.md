version 0.2.10 (Beta)

## Feedback?
All feedback is welcome! To send feedback you can either visit the Cortex Prime or FoundryVTT discords and @Necrophage for any feedback. Additionally, you may submit an issue here on Github.

## Beta Version
This is currently in Beta. Most of the primary features have been implemented and tested through alpha. Adjustments or reworking of these features may still occur based on feedback. Which means there is a risk of breaking changes with major updates. Many of the minor updates should not break anything. Please do expect some lingering bugs from the core features and from any new enhancement features that may occur during Beta.

## How to use
When creating a new world the GM will have to set up the character sheet in the system settings, including their trait sets, traits, and all of their various options.

To see how to use this system, there is a help tab in the actor sheets that will give a breakdown on their current features.
