## Warning: Alpha Version
This is currently in Alpha. Which means there is a risk of breaking changes with every update. Many of the features are still being worked on. It is currently playable, however, expect bugs and you may need to use the features that currently exist in different ways to make up for a feature that is not yet released.

## How to use
When creating a new world the GM will have to set up the character sheet in the system settings, including their trait sets, traits, and all of their various options.

To see how to use this system, there is a help tab in the actor sheets that will give a breakdown on their current features.
